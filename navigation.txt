# Setup

Ensure your iTerm is set up to use opt as meta (M), instead of / as well as Esc.

Learn your iTerm commands for splitting horizontally and vertically!

These are Cmd-d and Cmd-Shift-d by default.

## Note

These are all Emacs shortcuts. If you learn Emacs, you'll learn
these and some more that don't work on the terminal.

You can put the terminal into Vi mode, but it's a nightmare
IMO.

## Watch out!

These keys are close to common bindings: C-s (freeze) and C-q
(unfreeze) the terminal.

## Move back / forward characters

C-b / C-f

## Move back / forward words

M-b / M-f

## Move to beginning of line

C-a

## Move to end of line

C-e
