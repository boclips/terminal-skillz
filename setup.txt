# Setup

Ensure your iTerm is set up to use opt as meta (M), instead of / as well as
Esc.

Learn your iTerm commands for splitting horizontally and vertically!

These are Cmd-d and Cmd-Shift-d by default.

## Note

Most shortcuts are from Emacs. If you learn Emacs, you'll learn these and some
more that don't work on the terminal.

You can put the terminal into Vi mode, but it's a nightmare
IMO.

## Feedback

Visual feedback is important - learning to touch type can really help.

## Watch out!

These keys are close to common bindings: C-s (freeze) and C-q
(unfreeze) the terminal.

To turn these off:

stty -ixon
